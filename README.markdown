#Vigor

Vigor is tiny! It was just born, and it's very weak. Someday, it hopes to make
configuring Vim a breeze.

Vigor aims to create an easier-to-understand syntax for Vim settings and to
output nice, clean Vim configuration.

In its efforts to simplify Vim configuration, Vigor makes two decisions:

- It won't have a mapping for every possible Vim configuration setting, but it
  will cover the most common ones.
- The ones it can set, it will make as human-readable as possible

Because Vigor won't do **everything** that a `.vimrc` can do, it's not meant to
replace your `.vimrc` but rather to augment it. Vigor will output valid Vim
commands to a file, and you can `:source` that file from your `.vimrc`.
If there's a Vim setting that you want which Vigor doesn't support, you can 
set it directly in your `.vimrc` 

Hopefully, as Vigor becomes more vigorous, your `.vimrc` file will get shorter and
will pull most of its settings from Vigor's output file.
