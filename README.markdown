#Vigor

Vigor is tiny! It was just born, and it's very weak. Someday, it hopes to make
configuring Vim a breeze.

Vigor aims to create an easier-to-understand syntax for Vim settings and to
output nice, clean Vim configuration.

In its efforts to simplify Vim configuration, Vigor makes two decisions:

- It won't have a mapping for every possible Vim configuration setting, but it
  will cover the most common ones.
- The ones it can set, it will make as human-readable as possible

Because Vigor won't do **everything** that a .vimrc can do, it's not meant to
replace your .vimrc, but rather to augment it. Vigor will output valid Vim
commands directives to a file, and you can `:source` that file from your
.vimrc. If there's a Vim setting that you want which Vigor doesn't support,
you can set it directly in your .vimrc. 

Hopefully, as Vigor becomes more robust, your .vimrc file will get shorter and
will pull
